This section will try to summarize the findings of this project.

The project have shown that a domain specific language can enhance the speed of the development of a project, once the language is created.
However the more general the language is supposed to be, the harder the language will end up being. 
Further will it also require more time to develop.
It is a trade os between customizability and generality.
The project have found a number of disadvantages of the DSL, however they can all be solved given more time to develop.
