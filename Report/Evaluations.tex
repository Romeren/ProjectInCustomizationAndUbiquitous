This section will try to summarize the findings of this project.

The project have shown that a domain specific language can enhance the speed of the development
of a project, once the language is created. However the more general the language is supposed to
be, the harder the language will end up being. Further it also require more time to develop an
external DSL compared to making just 1 case, and therefore it should first be applied once the
domain specific language has the job to generate a solution for multiple cases.
The main issue at the development and design process is to choose the right trade between
customizability and generality.
The project have found a number of disadvantages of the resulting language, however nearby all of
the issues can be solved given more time development time.
